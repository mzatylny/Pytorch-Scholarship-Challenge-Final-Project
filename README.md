# Developing an AI application
Going forward, AI algorithms will be incorporated into more and more everyday applications. For example, you might want to include an image classifier in a smart phone app. To do this, you'd use a deep learning model trained on hundreds of thousands of images as part of the overall application architecture. A large part of software development in the future will be using these types of models as common parts of applications. 
In this project, you'll train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. You can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at. In practice you'd train this classifier, then export it for use in your application. We'll be using this dataset of 102 flower categories. 

**The dataset**

You can download the images from here:

**The project is broken down into multiple steps:**

Load and preprocess the image dataset

Train the image classifier on your dataset

Use the trained classifier to predict image content


**This is only an example solution my final version is lost**

I trained the model on GTX 1060

I used pretrained network densenet161 

The model accuracy is 94.6%
